\subsection{Hypothesis on Embedding Method Category}
\label{sec:hypothesis_embedding_method_category}

\begin{hypothesis}
\label{hyp:embedding_method_category}
Prediction quality varies between models of different embedding methods with specific categories.
\end{hypothesis}

The purpose of this hypothesis is to examine importance and characteristics of different embedding method categories.

To test this we need multiple methods of each category.

\begin{subhypothesis}
\label{subhyp:transformation_better_relation_time}
Prediction quality of queries where the prediction target is $r$ or $\tau$ is better for models of embedding methods with the transformation category.
\end{subhypothesis}

The purpose of this sub-hypothesis is to examine a suggestion from our earlier research.
