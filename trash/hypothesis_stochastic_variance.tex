\subsection{Hypothesis on Stochastic Variance}
\label{sec:hypothesis_stochastic_variance}

\begin{hypothesis}
\label{hyp:stochastic_variance}
Prediction quality varies between models of same embedding methods trained on different train-test-validation splits of the same datasets.
\end{hypothesis}

The purpose of this hypothesis is to evaluate the importance of stochastic variance in the training data. \missing[Daniele had an article about the topic, may be nice to ref here].

To test this we need multiple splits of a dataset and to ensure the data is not coincidental we need multiple datasets and multiple methods.
As training models is time consuming, it is best to limit the experiment to as few models as possible while fulfilling these requirements.
%Therefore we use three training splits on all three datasets and the methods \missing.
The methods examined in this hypothesis should be selected such that they are the least time consuming subset of all selected methods.
