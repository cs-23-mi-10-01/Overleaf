This paper is a continuation of [semester 9], where we found that the quality of the predictions highly depended on the target of the prediction. Highest performance was observed on tail predictions, followed by head, relation and time predictions. In this paper, this observation will be more thoroughly examined and tested with more datasets and train/test splits of the data.

In addition, it was observed that the best indicator for prediction quality seemed to be the relation type. In this paper, this concept will be expanded, by looking at the relations in the knowledge graph, categorizing them and evaluating the performance of the models over different categories of relations. The relations are categorized into structural features, which as symmetry, anti-symmetry, inversion, composition and heirarchy. Their temporal nature will also be examined, such as the average duration of events and relations.

Ultimately, the findings will contribute to an ensemble learning model with dynamic weights across different models, depending on the features of the query.
