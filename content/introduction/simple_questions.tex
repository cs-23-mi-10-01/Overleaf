Questions can be divided into three types: Simple, multi-hop and complex.
Simple questions can be answered with a single triple \cite{bordes2015simple}, multi-hop questions require a path of triples \cite{zhang2017multihop}, and complex questions require logical reasoning over multiple triples \cite{talmorberant2018decomposition}.
We focus on simple questions as complex and multi-hop questions can be deconstructed to multiple simple questions. \cite{yani2021}

Most \gls{qa} systems consist of two parts: (1) Translating a question in natural language to a query (2) Resolving the query.
We do not consider the first problem as the aim of the survey is to investigate embedding methods and their qualities.
As simple questions can be expressed as a tuple, the task of simple \gls{qa} here corresponds to the task of link prediction, which enables us to select datasets developed for that task as well as datasets developed for \gls{qa}.
