\section{Preliminary Experiments}
\label{sec:preliminary_experiments}

Before evaluating the hypotheses we performed experiments to examine results from our previous work. These experiments support the validity of our research and provide insights into tendencies exhibited in the link prediction results. However, they do not suppport any hypothesis and are therefore separated in this section.
Previously, we found an indication that all models achieved better results depending on the prediction target and that all models followed the same preference pattern for prediction target. This is further investigated in \autoref{subsec:dataset_split_comparisons}.
Additionally, previous results showed a particularly bad performance on timestamp predictions. Therefore, in \autoref{subsec:temporal_precision} we investigate the precision of the timestamp predictions to uncover the size of the problem.
