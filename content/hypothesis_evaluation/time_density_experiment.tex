\subsection{Time Density}
\label{sec:time_density_experiment}

Hypothesis \ref{hyp:time_density} concerns the density of facts over time in datasets. In \autoref{sec:hypothesis_time_density}, the experiment approach is explained, and in this section the findings are presented. In \autoref{fig:time_density_comparison}, the results are noted, using MRR as the metric. As shown in the table, the score of the models are higher in temporally sparse parts of the dataset than it is in the temporally dense parts, in the ICEWS14 and WIKIDATA datasets. In the YAGO dataset, this tendency is reversed, as the score of the dense parts of the dataset is higher than it is in the sparse parts of the dataset.
