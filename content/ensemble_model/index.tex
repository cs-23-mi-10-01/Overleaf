\section{Ensemble Model}
\label{sec:ensemble_model}
The purpose of the ensemble experiement is to find the impact of our findings in the hypothesis. This is done by creating two ensemble voting mathods. The first method is the naive ensemble voting where each method have the same weight when deciding the answer to a query. the second is the decision three ensemble voting, where based on our findings and what query that is to be answered, the methods have different weights, and therefore different levels of importance when answering the query.
