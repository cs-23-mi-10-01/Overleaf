\label{sec:hypothesis_\thehcounter}

\begin{quote}
\customlabel{hypothesis\thehcounter}{H\thehcounter}:
Prediction quality varies between models of different embedding methods with specific categories.
\end{quote}

The purpose of this hypothesis is to examine importance and characteristics of different embedding method categories.

To test this we need multiple methods of each category.

\begin{quote}
\customlabel{hypothesis\thehcounter\alph{hsubcounter}}
{H\thehcounter (\alph{hsubcounter})}:
Prediction quality of queries where the prediction target is $r$ or $\tau$ is better for models of embedding methods with the transformation category.
\end{quote}

The purpose of this sub-hypothesis is to examine a suggestion from our earlier research.
