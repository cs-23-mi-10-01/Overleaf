\subsection{Hypothesis \thehcounter} %time granularity
\label{sec:hypothesis_\thehcounter}

\begin{quote}
\customlabel{hypothesis\thehcounter}{H\thehcounter}:
Prediction quality of queries where the prediction target $\tau$ is improved by considering precision granularity of predictions.
\end{quote}

The purpose of this hypothesis is to examine how far wrong predictions on $\tau$ are from the right results. 
In contrast to the remaining fact elements, $\tau$ is a continuous rather than discrete value and as such it is possible to measure degrees of precision.

To test this we need to measure the distance between predicted and correct values.
\missing[This is done both by considering the amount of correct predictions on different levels of time granularity and by calculating the distance between predicted and correct answers.]
