\section{Hypotheses}
\label{sec:hypotheses}

We have formulated the following three hypotheses on properties of \gls{tkg} queries.
They are constructed such that the results quantify the strengths and weaknesses of each method such that they can be used in an ensemble learning method.
The hypotheses concern prediction quality, which is measured using \gls{mrr} score.
