\label{sec:methods}

The selection of methods in this paper has been expanded from [semester 9] to include a wider selection of highly-performing methods, which cover a wider array of embedding categories and relation types. The methods included in this paper is DE-TransE, DE-SimplE, DE-DistMult, TeRo, ATiSE and RE-Net, to cover all categories. In addition, methods were selected to include both those that has complete expressiveness over all possible relation structures, as well as those that has only partial expressiveness, to enable analysis of the impact of the structure of the data and method.
