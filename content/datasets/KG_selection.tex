\subsection{Selection of KGs}
\label{subsec:selection_of_kgs}
An adapted version of the framework introduced in \cite{farber2017dataquality} is used to aid in selecting the best \glspl{kg} for the purpose.
This framework defines a set of data quality criteria grouped in dimensions and categories and each criterion is associated with a function and a weight.
The function determines the value of that criterion for each \gls{kg} on a [0-1] scale and the weight determines the importance of that criterion in the context of a selected task.
The fulfillment degree $h(g)$ is a weighted normalized sum of the criteria determining how well each \gls{kg} fulfills the requirements of the task.
A detailed description of the conducted analysis is available in \autoref{app:kg_selection_framework}.

The analyzed \glspl{kg} are DBPEDIA, FreeBase, OpenCyc, WikiData \cite{vrandecic2014wikidata}, YAGO \cite{mahdisoltani2015YAGO3}, WordNet, ICEWS, and GDELT.

\begin{comment}

OpenCyc is disregarded as it stores no temporal information, is significantly smaller than the other graphs and only partly available as it is a subgraph of a proprietary graph.

something about consistency and it being a problem
