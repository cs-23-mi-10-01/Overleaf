abstract = {Acknowledging the dynamic nature of knowledge graphs, the problem of learning temporal knowledge graph embeddings has recently gained attention. Essentially, the goal is to learn vector representation for the nodes and edges of a knowledge graph taking time into account. These representations must preserve certain properties of the original graph, so as to allow not only classification or clustering tasks, as for classical graph embeddings, but also approximate time-dependent query answering or link predictions over knowledge graphs. For instance, "who was the leader of Germany in 1994?'' or "when was Bonn the capital of Germany?''Several existing work in the area adapt existing knowledge graph embedding models, adding a time dimension, usually restricting to one time granularity, like years or days, or treating time as fixed labels. However, this is not adequate for many facts of life, for instance historical and sensory data. In this work, we introduce and evaluate an approach that gracefully adjusts to time validity of virtually any granularity. Our model is robust to non-contiguous validity periods. It is generic enough to adapt to many existing non-temporal models and its size (number of parameters) does not depend on the size of the graph (number of entities and relations).},

Our objective is to propose a canonical model which is easy to train, contains a reduced number of parameters and can scale up to very large databases. Hence, we propose TransE, a method which models relationships by interpreting them as translations operating on the low-dimensional embeddings of the entities. Despite its simplicity, this assumption proves to be powerful since extensive experiments show that TransE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in link prediction on two knowledge bases. Besides, it can be successfully trained on a large scale data set with 1M entities, 25k relationships and more than 17M training samples.},

Relational facts in KG often show temporal dynamics, e.g., the fact (Cristiano{\_}Ronaldo, playsFor, Manchester{\_}United) is valid only from 2003 to 2009. Most of the existing KG embedding methods ignore this temporal dimension while learning embeddings of the KG elements. In this paper, we propose HyTE, a temporally aware KG embedding method which explicitly incorporates time in the entity-relation space by associating each timestamp with a corresponding hyperplane. HyTE not only performs KG inference using temporal guidance, but also predicts temporal scopes for relational facts with missing time annotations. Through extensive experimentation on temporal datasets extracted from real-world KGs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model over both traditional as well as temporal KG embedding methods.",

Here, we present a novel approach to relational learning based on the factorization of a three-way tensor. We show that unlike other tensor approaches, our method is able to perform collective learning via the latent components of the model and provide an efficient algorithm to compute the factorization. We substantiate our theoretical considerations regarding the collective learning capabilities of our model by the means of experiments on both a new dataset and a dataset commonly used in entity resolution. Furthermore, we show on common benchmark datasets that our approach achieves better or on-par results, if compared to current state-of-the-art relational learning solutions, while it is significantly faster to compute.},

    abstract = "Entity alignment aims to identify equivalent entity pairs between different knowledge graphs (KGs). Recently, the availability of temporal KGs (TKGs) that contain time information created the need for reasoning over time in such TKGs. Existing embedding-based entity alignment approaches disregard time information that commonly exists in many large-scale KGs, leaving much room for improvement. In this paper, we focus on the task of aligning entity pairs between TKGs and propose a novel Time-aware Entity Alignment approach based on Graph Neural Networks (TEA-GNN). We embed entities, relations and timestamps of different KGs into a vector space and use GNNs to learn entity representations. To incorporate both relation and time information into the GNN structure of our model, we use a self-attention mechanism which assigns different weights to different nodes with orthogonal transformation matrices computed from embeddings of the relevant relations and timestamps in a neighborhood. Experimental results on multiple real-world TKG datasets show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods due to the inclusion of time information.",
